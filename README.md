## Musiikkilevyhaku
A mobile application used for getting information about a music CD/record by scanning its barcode or by its catalog ID/title. The application also allows you to listen to samples of the tracks on the CD/record. There is also a simple server which can be used to back up your list of your favourite CDs and records. 

Made for a school assignment (2017).
